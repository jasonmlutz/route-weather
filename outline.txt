#route-weather
Goal: build independent modules for each task.
1. (starting location, destination) --> (driving (?) route)
2. (driving route) --> (locations at 30/60 minute intervals)
3. (location + time) --> (weather forecast)

Then put it all together.

Progress:
 - fetch location
 - verify location
 - fetch directions
